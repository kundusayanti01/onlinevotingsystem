        <p>
          Voting is a fundamental right and a crucial aspect of a democratic
          society. However, many people face barriers that prevent them from
          voting, such as long lines, distance, or other accessibility
          challenges. Online voting addresses these issues by:

          <li>
            <strong>Increasing Accessibility:</strong> Allowing individuals to
            vote from any location, which is especially beneficial for those in
            remote or rural areas.

          <li>
            <strong>Encouraging Participation:</strong> Providing a convenient
            and user-friendly option that may encourage higher voter turnout.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Reducing Costs:</strong> Minimizing the expenses of physical
            polling locations and paper ballots.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Enhancing Security:</strong> Using secure and encrypted
            systems to protect the integrity of each vote.
